## Hi, I am Gustavo Escobar Cobos :wave:

I'm a Freelance Developer who loves to learn about new things. I'm in Caracas, Venezuela.

### Bio

- 🏢 I studied 8 semesters of Computer Science degree at the Central University of Venezuela. I didn't finish my studies, it is a debt that I owe myself.
- 📱 In 2021, together with [MyWololo](https://mywololo.com), I built an App with Flutter and Back End in Laravel. The name of the project is [Gabu](https://gabu.app), the owner of the project is from El Salvador.
- 💻 Also in 2021, I was an Software Architect and Back-End Developer at [Video Portal de Negocios de Cohen y Aguirre](https://videoportaldenegocios.es)
- ⚙️ I use daily: `C#`, `ASP.NET Core`, `PHP`, `Laravel`, `Git`, `MySQL` and `SQL Server`
